The experiment is interesting because results in a bell inequality violation
which proves that a local hidden variable explanation to QM is impossible
unless you violate special relativity by introducing super luminal
information transfer (which makes the HVT pointless as it's original
purpose in the EPR paper was to remove an incompatibility between QM and SR).

"A 5 mW freerunning InGaN diode laser produces a beam of violet
(405 nm) photons which pass through a blue filter, a linear polarizer,
and a birefringent plate before reaching a pair of beta barium borate
(BBO) crystals."
The crystals are placed face to face. Crystal #1 is rotated 0 degrees
in relation to the polarization of the laser while the crystal #2 is
rotated 90 degrees in respect to it.
The crystals allow the possibility of Type-I spontaneous parametric
down-conversion (SPCD). The reason why the photons are split are not
understood at a fundamental level but irrelevant to the purpose of the
experiment. When SPCD occurs in one of the crystals the two resulting
photons will be emitted at a random angle in a "cone trajectory" where
each photon has a relative 180 degree angle in respect to each other.
The emitted photons is ordinary polarized relative to the axis of the
crystal that generated them. The crystals are 0.1 mm thick and the beam
itself is 1 mm thick. This makes the crystals thin enough that the
resulting SPDC light cone from each crystal almost completely overlaps.
This erases the information of which crystal the SPDC originated from
(the which-path information) making it impossible to know the polarization
from measuring the photon position alone. Therefore the light cones are in a
superposition of polarization states. We can find entangled photon pairs
at any points around the cone, opposite of each other with correlating
polarization.
